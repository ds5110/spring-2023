## 03-Tidy

## Goals

* EDA with multivariable dataset (case study: USGS earthquake API)
* Processing and managing tidy/tabular data -- Pandas & Numpy
* Statistical visualization (with Seaborn and friends)

## Notebooks

* [02-numpy.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ESDqb8LMcwTr8bjbdLDt_WACSzXBbP8z)
  * NumPy can do multidimensional arrays, among other amazing things!

  * Grouping with Pandas
* [02-quakes-exercises.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O91p2-FOs4VnmZmXFHbqyzq3q9xGIIxT)
  * histograms of earthquakes -- last month, all sizes
  * includes links to USGS API documentation and GeoJSON data model and data dictionary

### Projects

* Mention them

### EDA of earthquakes

* Picking up from where we left off last week
* Last week, histograms exhibited two features of interest in the earthquakes from the previous month...
  * time dependent ditribution in earthquake (global aggregation) -- would expect a uniform distribution
  * magnitude has bi-modal distribution  -- would expect monotonic decrease in magnitude (skewed distribution)
  * wikipedia references...
    * [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)
    * [skewed distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) 
    * [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

### EDA continued -- What's going on?

Adding maps, working with the API

* [03-geopandas-exercises.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Afw2dOJC_i8EreT2Fp8AtjO8cn1nGZ83)
